          We have built our website using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript
          framework, and utilized Axios, a popular HTTP client, to fetch data
          from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spoonacular's API.</span>This powerful combination allows us to
          efficiently retrieve and display information about different dishes .
          We have taken great care to ensure that our website is intuitive,
          user-friendly, and visually appealing, making your culinary journey as
          enjoyable as possible.
